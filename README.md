# LinkedIn Network UI

A modern, responsive LinkedIn Network page UI built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates professional frontend development practices with clean code organization, responsive design, and modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on all devices
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, professional design following LinkedIn's design language
- **Interactive Components**: Dynamic connection tracker, people suggestions, and more
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient code with lazy loading and optimized animations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Cross-browser Compatible**: Works on all modern browsers



### 🚀 **Main Motivation - Solving a Real LinkedIn Problem**

**The Core Problem:**
LinkedIn has a **weekly connection limit of 100 requests** per user, but provides **no built-in tracker** to monitor this limit. Users often:
- Send connection requests blindly without knowing their remaining quota
- Hit the limit unexpectedly and get blocked from networking
- Have no visibility into their connection request patterns
- Cannot track pending requests effectively

**My Solution:**
I built this LinkedIn Network UI with a **Connection Tracker Widget** that provides:
- **Visual Progress Bar**: Shows exactly how many connections used (e.g., "2 of 100 used")
- **Real-time Percentage**: Current usage displayed as a percentage (2%)
- **Pending Requests Counter**: Track requests waiting for response (5 pending)
- **Recently Accepted Stats**: Monitor successful connections (8 in last 30 days)
- **Detailed Analytics**: Comprehensive stats including acceptance rates and ignored requests

**Why This Matters:**
- **Prevents Limit Violations**: Users can see exactly where they stand
- **Optimizes Networking Strategy**: Make informed decisions about when to send requests
- **Improves Success Rates**: Track what works and what doesn't
- **Saves Time**: No more guesswork or manual counting

**Technical Achievement:**
Built this essential missing feature using vanilla JavaScript, proving that:
- Complex UI problems can be solved without heavy frameworks
- Professional-grade interfaces can be created with core web technologies
- Real user problems drive the best development projects
